CREATING A MENU BASE PROJECT BY PYTHON for accessing more in a one place.
The provided code is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the Tkinter library. The application offers various functions, each associated with a button. Here's a summary of what the code does:

1. **Imports:** The code begins by importing several libraries, including Tkinter for GUI, webbrowser for opening web pages, cv2 for working with computer vision (OpenCV), requests for making HTTP requests, speech_recognition for speech recognition, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, pywhatkit for sending WhatsApp messages, PIL for working with images, threading for multi-threading, time for managing time-related operations, pygame for audio playback, pandas for data manipulation, and os and subprocess for interacting with the operating system.

2. **Function Definitions:**
   - `recognize_speech()`: Uses speech_recognition to capture audio from the microphone, performs speech recognition using Google's speech-to-text service, and displays the recognized text.
   - `send_whatsapp_message()`: Sends a WhatsApp message using pywhatkit library, specifying the recipient's number, message content, and desired sending time.
   - `create_python_menu()`: Opens a new top-level Tkinter window with buttons for various Python-related options.
   - Functions for opening web pages: `open_chrome()`, `open_facebook()`, `open_linkedin()`, and `open_youtube()` open respective URLs using the webbrowser library.
   - `capture_image()`: Uses OpenCV to capture an image from the computer's camera, converts it to grayscale, and displays it.
   - `set_alarm()`: Prompts the user to set an alarm time and waits until the specified time to play an alarm sound using pygame.
   - `play_alarm_sound()`: Plays an alarm sound using pygame.
   - `button_click(button_number)`: Calls the appropriate function based on the button number clicked.

3. **Tkinter GUI Setup:**
   - The code sets up a main Tkinter window named "Menu-Based Project."
   - Loads and resizes a background image to fit the window.
   - Creates a frame for buttons and positions it on the right side.
   - Creates buttons for setting and stopping an alarm.
   - Creates buttons for various actions using information from the `buttons_info` list.
